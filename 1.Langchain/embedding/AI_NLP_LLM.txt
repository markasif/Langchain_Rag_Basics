Title: Introduction to AI and NLP for LLMs

1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

1.1 Types of AI
- Narrow AI (Weak AI): Designed to perform a specific task (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).
- General AI (Strong AI): Aims to perform any intellectual task a human can do.
- Super AI: A hypothetical AI surpassing human intelligence in all aspects.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

3. Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs are advanced deep learning models trained on massive amounts of text data to generate human-like text.

4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in LLMs
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by fetching relevant documents from external sources to improve response quality.

5. Conclusion
AI and NLP have revolutionized how we interact with machines. With advancements in LLMs and techniques like RAG, AI-powered applications are becoming more accurate and context-aware.
